        <h2>Early Confusion about COVID-19</h2>
        <p>The World Health Organization informed the public on January 14, 2020 that there is “no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission.”</p>
        <p>During the beginning of the pandemic, there was much confusion surrounding accurate information of the virus because scientists were still learning about it. This resulted in mixed messages from health organizations regarding the importance of wearing masks.</p>
        <p>Conflicting messages also resulted from balancing the safety of health care workers and the public when faced with limited supplies of masks.</p>
        <p>Research shows that people turn to experts during times of national crisis, but the uncertainty from experts made political leaders a leading source for guidance and clarity.</p>

          <h2>Controversy of Masks</h2>
          <p>Democratic politicians quickly adopted mask-wearing and many Democratic governors made it mandatory to wear masks in public.</p>
          <p>Many Republican politicans have also spoken out about the importance of wearing a mask, though other influential Republicans hesitate on the topic of mandating masks (like...Trump...) </p>
          <p>Though the CDC recommends wearing masks to prevent the spread of the virus, President Trump has suggested wearing a mask could be seen as a political statement against him and mocked Biden for wearing a mask in public.</p>
          <p>There has also been a formation of a group of people protesting against mask mandates known as "anti-maskers", whom believe mask mandates sacrifice individual liberty.</p>

            <h2>Fake News Spreads Faster Than a Virus</h2>
            <p>Much like a virus, researchers say that over time being exposed to fake news can wear down a person’s resistance and make them increasingly susceptible. The more times a person is exposed to a piece of fake news, especially if it comes from an influential source, the more likely they are to become persuaded.</p>
            <p>The so-called “power law” of social media, a well-documented pattern in social networks, holds that messages replicate most rapidly if they are targeted at relatively small numbers of influential people with large followings.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="fakenews2">
            <h3>What kinds of people are most susceptible?</h3>
            <p>In the broadest sense it is partisans at the political extremes, whether liberal or conservative, who are most like to believe a false story in part because of confirmation bias – the tendency in all of us to believe stories that reinforce our convictions – and the stronger those convictions, the more powerfully the person feels the pull of confirmation bias.</p>

            <h2>Tweet Set Off Flurry of Anti-Mask Posts</h2>
            <p>For months, public health experts have stood firm on one resounding refrain: Against the coronavirus, masks work.</p>
            <p>On Saturday however, Dr. Scott Atlas, one of President Trump’s most prominent science advisers, took to Twitter to say otherwise. The next day, Twitter removed Dr. Atlas’s tweet, saying it violated the company’s policy against false or misleading information about the coronavirus that could lead to harm.</p>
            <p>The post had been retweeted at least 1,800 times, and generated over 7,300 likes and replies. The removal then set off a flurry of anti-mask posts, and accusations of tech censorship, across social media. On Facebook, several right-wing pages shared copies of the tweet, while a series of anti-mask and pro-Trump groups and pages claimed that Twitter was suppressing free speech.</p>

            <h2>Science Not Politics</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Current existing <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0843-2">studies</a> have shown that masks and face coverings can act as a barrier for droplets expelled by the wearer, which are resposible for the majority of transmission of the COVID-19 virus.</li>
              <li>An estimated 40% of people infected with COVID-19 are asymptomatic but are able to transmit the virus to others.</li>
              <li><a href="https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america">Disease modeling</a> suggests universal mask use can significantly reduce virus transmission in the community by preventing carriers from transmitting to others.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="section4">
            <p>There are many forms of styles and materials the masks are made of: tightly woven cotton outperforms most common fabric while a nonwoven material like the N95 respirator is most effective.</p>
            <p>Wearing a mask is NOT a restriction of freedom, but rather the opposite. It allows us to reduce virus transmission in the community and make every interaction safer. Freedom for people to go to work, attend school, interact with others, and most importantly freedom from illness and fear.</p>
